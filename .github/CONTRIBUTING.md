These instructions are for contributing to the Lipika family of open source projects including but not limited to [lipika-engine](https://github.com/ratreya/lipika-engine), [lipika-ime](https://github.com/ratreya/lipika-ime) and [lipika-board](https://github.com/ratreya/lipika-board).

1. Download and setup the latest xcode from the appstore
1. Clone the appropriate Github Lipika project
1. Choose an issue or open a new issue for the planned work
    * Mark the issue as a *bug* or *feature* 
    * Use the appropriate template and fill it in
    * Assign the issue to yourself
    * You may also want to comment and ask for help if you’re new or if you get stuck. We’re happy to help!
1. Make changes with *test driven development* and make sure there is a regression that fails without your changes and passes with them
1. Make sure all other tests pass
1. Make one commit for one issue - a single unit of roll-back
1. Open a merge request
    * Use and fill in the merge request template
    * You can mark it as a Work in Progress to signal that you’re not done yet
1. Wait for a reviewer. You’ll likely need to change some things once the reviewer has completed a code review for your merge request. You may also need multiple reviews depending on the size of the change.
1. Get your changes merged!

If you have questions or concerns, please feel free to open an issue or post in the [user group](http://facebook.com/groups/lipika.ime).
